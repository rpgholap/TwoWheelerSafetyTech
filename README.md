# Two-Wheeler Safety System Solution Proposal for Pune

This repository contains the solution proposal for a **Two-Wheeler Safety System**, developed for the **Bosch Road Safety Hackathon 2024**. 
The goal is to address safety issues for two-wheeler riders by proposing a system that includes helmet detection, obstacle avoidance through radar technology, and an anti-lock braking system (ABS).

## Project Overview: 
The solution proposes an integrated safety system focusing on:
- **Helmet Detection**: A machine learning approach to identify helmet usage.
- **Obstacle Detection**: A radar-based system for real-time obstacle detection to prevent collisions.
- **Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)**: A braking system to enhance control and reduce brake wear during emergencies.
